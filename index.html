<h1> About me </h1>
<br>
<p> Hi, my name is Jacklin and I an a junior studing IT at NJIT. I have a lot of hobbies that relate to the creative arts. Some examples inlude art, writing, singing, and even game development. </p>
<br>
<p>I plan on making a demo for my game that will be published within the next couple of months. It will incorporate artworks that I love to draw, which includes character design, and concept art. I am not that much of a music producer, so I plan on hiring some composers for my project.</p>
<p> Here is a link that explains what kind of game I am making:</p>
